## How to Run

1. This project requires Expo CLI, install this with the command 'npm install --g explo-cli'
2. Change the directory to wherever this project is located and run the command 'expo start'
3. Install an Android or iPhone emulator on your device or install Expo on your real phone from the appstore.
4. Follow the terminal prompts to send the application to your real life phone or your running simulator.
   - This will work as long as the device you are trying to view the application in is on the same network as where you're running it.
